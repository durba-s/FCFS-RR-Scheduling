/**
 * Created ONLY to be used as a thread routine. 
 * The major components of this routine are the 'turn_lock' semaphore (referred to as 'turn'), 'done' status of the task, and the 'current_scheduled' shared memory block.
 * The scheduling algorithm writes the currently scheduled process to 'current_scheduled' shared memory block (shared amongst all processes). 
 * This routine polls the status of this block at regular intervals to determine the process that should be running currently.
 * If the process id matched the currently scheduled process, then the monitor thread signals the 'turn_lock' semaphore.
 *

 * 
 * Intricacies:
 * - The polling is done at regular time intervals, say t (until the task assigned has finished, indicated by the done variable.)
 *   If t is too short, then the state update latency would be low but CPU usage would spike. 
 *   If t is too long, then state update latency would be too high, and might miss the scheduler updates by a large margin.
 * 
 * - The value of the 'turn' semaphore is always either 0 or 1. 
 *  • 0 denotes it is not the currently scheduled process
 *  • 1 denotes it is the currently scheduled process
 * 
 * @param args: process state declared on the heap. Used for inter thread communitcation on the same process.
 * @return Return the final state of the process.

/**
 * Workers Created ONLY to be used as a thread routine.
 * The major components of this routine are the turn_lock and cpu_lock semaphores. 
 * 
 * We treat the CPU as a common resource, only one of which is available. This ensures that no two processes can do "effective work" at the same time. 
 * i.e. the worker thread loops of no two processes can run simultaneously. This is ensured using the cpu_lock semaphore.
 * - the value of 'cpu_lock' is always either 0 or 1.
 *  • 0 denotes that the cpu is busy, and in use
 *  • 1 denotes that the cpu is free to be acquired by a process
 * 
 * Before each iteration of the task begins, it must wait until the value of turn lock is 1, and then wait on the cpu_lock semaphore. 
 * This is to ensure that it is actually the turn of this process, and that no other process is working right now. 
 * At the end of each iteration, it must release the cpu_lock semaphore.
 * 
 * Consequently the waiting times, and turn around times are calculated in the worker thread only. 
 * EVEN if some other process has been scheduled, due to a worker thread being inside the loop, might be working.
 * This causes an increase in the waiting time of the newly scheduled process and must be accounted for. 
 * Similary for the Turn Around times.
 * 
 * @param args: process state declared on the heap. Used for inter thread communitcation on the same process.
 * @return Final state of the process.
